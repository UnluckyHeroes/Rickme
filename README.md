# UNLUCKY HEROES

Welcome to the Unlucky Heroes page! We are a team formed by six students of the Degree in [VideoGames Design and Development](https://www.citm.upc.edu/cat/estudis/graus-videojocs/) from [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/), at [Polithecnic University of Catalonia](http://www.upc.edu/ca).

## Rickme Project

Our latest project (in progress) is Rickme, a PC beat 'em up videogame in which you are a developer that must arrive on time to the E3 presentation with a stable build of a game.

However, the night before he discovers that the build crashes, so in his way to the E3 he will have to clean the build and providing stability to it by killing bugs, crashes, avoiding bad internet connections... He may also update the readme version by picking readme updates and all that in a limited time!
