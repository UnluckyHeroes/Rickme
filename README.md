## Rickme Project

Our latest project (in progress) is Rickme, a PC beat 'em up videogame in which you are a developer that must arrive on time to the E3 presentation with a stable build of a game.

However, the night before he discovers that the build crashes, so in his way to the E3 he will have to clean the build and providing stability to it by killing bugs, crashes, avoiding bad internet connections... He may also update the readme version by picking readme updates in order to use them as a virtual money and all that in a limited time!

Soon you will see the full gameplay here.

**Current Game Version:** v0.0
